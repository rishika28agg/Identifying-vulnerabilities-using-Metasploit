Identigying vulnerabilities using Metasploit - Introduction

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Problem statement – How can Metasploit be used efficiently to identify and exploit system and network vulnerabilities?
Objective – The primary objective of this assessment was to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers and to provide recommendations for rectifying these weaknesses to enhance the overall security posture through penetration testing.
Proposed solution – 
1. Network Scanning with Nmap: Discover how to scan networks for vulnerable services and open ports. This stage allows for the development of a comprehensive network map to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. Vulnerability Research: Once vulnerabilities are identified, we will investigate their effect and potential exploits.
3. Active Reconnaissance: To obtain a deeper understanding of the network, employ active reconnaissance techniques to gather precise information on the target systems.
4. Metasploit Framework Overview: We will learn about the Metasploit framework, which is an intricate tool that automates the process of exploiting system vulnerabilities.
5. Loading Metasploit Modules: Load and configure Metasploit modules to target and exploit vulnerabilities identified during scans.
6. Vulnerability Exploitation: Experiment safely with vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment to learn how attackers exploit system weaknesses.
7. Reporting and documentation: Prepare detailed penetration testing reports that include identified vulnerabilities, how they were exploited, and mitigation methods.

WHAT ARE VULNERABILITIES?
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that enable threats to compromise assets. They are primarily caused by hardware, software, network, and procedural problems. Hardware vulnerabilities include outdated systems, unprotected storage, and unencrypted devices. Software vulnerabilities are errors in development or configuration, whereas network vulnerabilities include unsecured communication, malware, social engineering attacks, and misconfigured firewalls. Procedural vulnerabilities exist in organizational workflows such as password and training procedures.
 
WHAT IS PENETRATION TESTING?
Penetration testing (or pen testing) is a security exercise in which a cyber-security specialist seeks to discover and exploit weaknesses in a computer network. This simulated attack is designed to detect flaws in a system's defences that attackers could exploit. Penetration testing assists an organization in identifying vulnerabilities and faults in its systems that would otherwise go undetected. Organizations may fix these vulnerabilities once they have been detected, which can help prevent attacks from happening.

OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
Virtual box - VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization tool designed for AMD or Intel computing architectures. It supports all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It enables users to operate desktops, servers, and operating systems as virtual machines. VirtualBox can enhance the technological capabilities of any compatible computer by allowing it to run numerous operating systems in independent virtual machines at the same time. It can be used for a variety of applications, including developing software for multiple platforms and establishing virtual networks for software testing.
Kali Linux - Kali Linux is an open-source Linux distribution for advanced security auditing and penetration testing. It offers hundreds of tools, configurations, and scripts with industry-specific modifications, allowing users to focus on tasks like computer forensics and vulnerability detection. It is tailored for experienced penetration testers.
Metasploit - Metasploit is a free, open-source penetration testing tool that enables security experts to detect and exploit system and network vulnerabilities. It is owned by Rapid7, a US-based cybersecurity organization. Metasploit has been developed in Ruby and pre-installed on Kali Linux. This virtual machine is compatible with VirtualBox, VMware, and other popular virtualization platforms.
Nmap - Network administrators can easily map an entire network to identify devices, open ports, and vulnerabilities with Nmap, an open-source Linux command-line tool created by Gordon Lyon that scans IP addresses, ports, and other installed applications.
